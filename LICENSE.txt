Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the software. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software—to make sure the software is free for all its users. To protect your rights, we need to make certain that you have the right to distribute copies of free software which are in principle free for all their users.

The actual tests are described below.
